Lion is one stop shop for all our financial needs. The company has
recently reached a milestone of going public, while much of the success
came from their innovation and vision to solve people’s financial needs,
it is no doubt a strong backend business system is part of the success.
Today I will be exploring and analysing their employee data which
reflects the hiring efficiency and employee productivity.

== 🎯 Project Goals and Objectives

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The objective is to extract actionable insights that would increase the
overall efficiency of the hiring process, increse employee productivity
and to mitigate losses on hiring investments.

=== A. Data Preparation

1.  This project is done both in excel and jupyter notebook(python)
* Work done in excel includes: sorting / filtering / adding Cost Center
column / Removing incomplete columns
* Work Done in python: removing Location column
2.  For this particular project for we do not remove any rows that has
the slightest information. Since we do not need to do predictive
analysis, we are not feeding the data for training hence any information
retained is valuable for our discovery. However, since location is a
constant feature, it does not provide any relevant information to our
analysis, we will remove it.
3.  Null value datas are wild cards that have weight in either category
of each unique column

=== B. Data Understanding and Basic Stats

*1. Data Accuracy*

We want to see if this data sample is accurate and correctly stored. -
Job Titlle with Levels (the logic assumption here is that a high level
executive would not be listed as L1/ L2)

We will only sample L1-L2 to see if any high level excutives are
mistakenly recorded.


+*In[22]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Checking for data accuracy 
search_values = ['L1','L2']
temp_df = df[df.Level.str.contains('|'.join(search_values))]
temp_df['Job Title'].value_counts()

Name: Job Title, dtype: int64----

Base on personal logic from the sample tested, there were no high level
executives that were mistakenly listed under L1 -L2 hence we would
assume that the data is accurate.

The Hiring rate has increased dramatically starting from year 2018 -
2021

*3. Level- We want to see if the compay consist of all levels of people*

Visualizing the data we can see that the data does not have employees of
level L5, L6, and L7 (Individual Contributor). This would mean that the
talent could be further motivated to achieve greater heights where they
can transcend to a L5/L6/L7 employee. Understanding this, the next step
is to think about how to create an environment / path that would
inspired people to think out of the box.

We can also see that there is one anomaly which is L8 and its not
classified under the leveling framework which is the Chief AI Officer.

*4. Department- Which department hires the most people*


+*In[5]:*+
[source, ipython3]

# Visualizing data

As a whole Product Engineers are hired the most. This shows where the
company’s emphasis and vision is on, making sure the application/
platform is properly configured for consumers.

Most of the employees are hired fulltime and very few are on a
contractual basis. While having a lot of fulltimers is great when there
is a lot of work to be done, an important factor to consider is whether
it increases the productivity and worth the ROI.

=== C. Exploratory Data Analysis

*1. Ratio for Level against Department & Cost Center*

To compare the distribution of Levels between Department and Cost
Centers we split it to two groups: - low_level (L1 - L4) - high_level
(LM5 - LM7)

*i) Level v Department*

----
# Copy data file

df_1 = df_1.dropna()
----


+*In[10]:*+
[source, ipython3]

# Creat a new dataframe with the counted values for each level to department 
lvd_df = pd.DataFrame({'Count' : df_1.groupby( ["Department", "Level"] ).size()}).reset_index()
lvd_df.hvplot.table(columns=['Department', 'Level','Count'], sortable=True, selectable=True,

Findings 1. Most effective method to hire High Level Employees are
through Referral 2. Jobstreet Hiring Source is the least effective in
hiring talent and also the worst option to hire high level talent 3.
This data recorded might not be accurate as there are repetitive
variables. 4. Most People that got promoted is only from L1 because
internal hires only consist of L2

Depending which type of talent we want to hire, we can look at the
histogram to see which is the most effective way to hire the specific
individual.

== 📋 Key Findings & Suggestion

*Key Findings* 1. Promotions only happen to people from L1 since
internal hire only consist of L2 2. Lack of Individual Contributor (L5,
L6, L7) 3. Lack of leadership in Marketing Analytics Department 4. Most
Expenses spent is on Engineering and AI cost centers 5. Best Hiring
Source for high level employees are through referral 6. Job street is
the worst option when it comes to hiring talent

*Suggestion for Improvement* 1. Since Promotion only happens to people
from L1, there is a question of whether talented people are leaving the
company or the promotion criteria is hard to achieve. Suggestion here is
to explore why talented people are leaving and how do you retain talent
from leaving.

....
 2. The lack of individual contributors raises the question of whether the talent hired are accurate to the leveling framework or the lack of inspirational events in the company. Suggestion here is to encourage employees to take part in leadership event and to train their ability to think out of the box. 
 
 3. Most expenses are spent on Engineering and hiring Product Engineers, the question we should ask here is whether the ROI is worth the investment? is everyone in the engineering department contributing to the productivity of the company? Suggestion here is to closely monitor everyone's KPI and do a simple ROI calculation to see whether it yields a positive return whether in the short/long term. 
 
 4. To minimize the budget and time spend recruitng talent, the company should cut of channels that does not yield a positive return and only focus on channels like 'Applied' / 'Referred' / 'Source'. Understand that we cant control the applicants that applied themselves, but the company could spend more time and budget on 'Referred' and 'Source.
